MP3 file farming software using automated linux terminal commands.

## How to Use:
1. Enter any song followed by the name of the artist (on the same line) into the 'Songs' file
2. Once the program outputs the first item entered followed by: '.mp4' into the console you are free to leave the program for the specified amount of time and let it farm the files
3. After all the recordings have been made, you will be required to enter 'y' to every console output saying a file is going to be overwritten
4. Finally, you can get rid of any remaining .mp4 files left in the directory - inside teh 'MPTHREE' directory is all the .mp3 files

## External Dependancies:
You will be required to install ytdlp, ffmpeg and youtubesearchpython
\n All of this can be done using the following commands:
```YoutubeDLP
pip install ytdlp
```
```FFMPEG
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
```YoutubeSearchPython
pip install youtubesearchpython
```
