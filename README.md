MP3 file farming software using automated linux terminal commands.

## How to Use:
1. Enter any song followed by the name of the artist (on the same line) into the 'Songs' file - make sure there song video isn't 18+ restricted on YT otherwise it won't load
2. (I have entered some into the file for an outline on how it should be formatted)
3. The program will give you an average amount of time to leave your PC AFK for
4. After all the recordings have been made and the AFK time is over, you will be required to enter 'y' to every python console output saying a file is going to be overwritten
5. Finally, you can get rid of any remaining .mp4 files left in the directory - inside the 'MPTHREE' directory is all the .mp3 files

## External Dependancies:
- You will be required to install ytdlp, ffmpeg and youtubesearchpython
- All of this can be done using the following commands:
```YoutubeDLP
pip install ytdlp
```
```FFMPEG
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
```YoutubeSearchPython
pip install youtubesearchpython
```
